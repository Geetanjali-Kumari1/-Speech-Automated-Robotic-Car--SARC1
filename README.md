# Arduino Bluetooth Robot Control

This Arduino project allows you to control a robotic car using voice commands sent through the Arduino Bluetooth controller application. The robotic car is equipped with four motors, a servo motor, an ultrasonic distance sensor, and an infrared sensor. The Bluetooth controller app enables you to wirelessly communicate with the robot and control its movements using your mobile device.
We named it as "SARC".

## Features
- Bluetooth control: Use the Arduino Bluetooth controller application to send voice commands and control the robotic car.
- Ultrasonic sensor: Detect obstacles and avoid collisions while moving.
- Infrared sensor: Detect objects behind the car when moving backward.
- Servo motor: Use a servo motor to rotate the car left and right.

## Hardware Requirements
• Arduino UNO
• L293D Motor Driver
• TT gear motor
• Rubber wheels
• HC05 Bluetooth module

## How to Use
1. Connect the hardware components according to the provided wiring diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch (SARC_code1.ino) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the HC-05  Bluetooth module to the Arduino board.
4. Install the Arduino Bluetooth controller application on your mobile device (Android or iOS).
5. Pair the Bluetooth module with your mobile device.
6. Open the Arduino Bluetooth controller app and connect to the Bluetooth module.
7. Use the voice control feature in the app to send commands to the robotic car.
